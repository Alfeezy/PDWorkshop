## PureData Workshop 
### Author: Bastien Gliech

#### Description
This is a repository of a lot of my basic PD notes. PureData was originally written by Miller Puckeete, and I do not own the application in any way. These notes are meant as a basis for new user of the program to understand how to explore what's possible.

#### To Install PureData
1. Download the appropriate install file from [their website](https://puredata.info/)
2. Install it, of course!
